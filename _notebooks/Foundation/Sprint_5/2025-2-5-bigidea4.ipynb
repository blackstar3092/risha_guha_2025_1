    "**We created a camping and national park review site.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project is structured to provide a seamless integration between the frontend and backend. Below is an outline of the current repository setup, including subdomains, and frontend/backend port configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Backend:** Our backend repository is Flask based and runs on the port 8887 which is used for API requests and is the port we use to test it in postman. It is responsible for processing data, interactign with the database, and sending responses to frontend (JSON). The backend contains each of our APIs under the folder .py which all work through our main.py. Each of our APIs has a corresponding model under the model folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Frontend:** Our frontend communicates the backend through RESTful APIs. The frontend runs on 4887 and sends HTTP requests to the backend. Our frontend is configured to fetch data from backend, process user data, then display it. The frontend 4887 sends API requests to the backend 8887. The backend processes the request, and interacts with the database. The frontend then updates the user interface based on the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How our Features Interact with the Frontend and Backend**\n",
    "- REVIEW FEATURE: The backend API handles CRUD operations for the Review model, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete reviews through routes like /api/review. The frontend interacts with these endpoints by sending HTTP requests, such as POST for creating reviews and GET for fetching them, often passing a JWT token for authentication. The backend processes these requests, interacting with the database via SQLAlchemy and returning relevant data to the frontend.\n",
    "\n",
    "- GEMINI API: The Gemini API integrates with Google Generative AI to provide a chatbot that generates camping-related advice based on user inputs. When a user sends a message, the backend uses the AI model to generate a response, updates the conversation history, and stores both the user input and AI response in the database. The backend supports CRUD operations, allowing users to interact with the chatbot, update messages, and delete them via HTTP requests, while maintaining a persistent chat session.\n",
    "\n",
    "- QUIZ API: This Flask API handles quiz result submissions, retrieval, updates, and deletions for users, storing the data in the quiz_results table linked to the Frostbyte user model. The frontend sends requests to the /api/quiz endpoints (via HTTP methods like POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) to interact with quiz results, while the backend processes these requests, assigning national parks based on the user's quiz score and managing the results in the database. The frontend can display the assigned national park and allow users to view, update, or delete their quiz results based on their interaction with the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "- LOCATION API: The Location API allows the frontend to manage user-specific location data, including storing, retrieving, and deleting location information linked to users and channels. It provides endpoints for creating and updating locations, fetching a user's location by their ID and channel, and deleting specific location records by ID. The backend uses SQLAlchemy to interact with the Location model, which stores location data in the database and ensures that each user's location is properly tracked, while utilizing JWT token-based authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ANALYTICS API: The Analytics API allows the frontend to send and retrieve analytics data related to user reviews, such as star ratings for specific channels. Users can submit individual or bulk analytics entries, which are stored in the database, while the frontend can also request an overall summary of average ratings and review counts for each channel. The backend ensures proper validation and error handling for all requests, and provides CRUD operations for managing analytics data, which is stored in the Analytics model and can be queried for reporting purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- POST API: The Post API allows the frontend to create, update, retrieve, and delete posts associated with specific channels and users. The backend handles these requests by interacting with the Post model, which is stored in a SQL database using SQLAlchemy, ensuring each post has a title, comment, content, and references to the user and channel. Through CRUD operations, the frontend can send requests to create posts, view individual or multiple posts, or delete posts, with responses being returned in JSON format for seamless integration with the frontend interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Subdomain** To ensure that the frontend can communicate with the backend during development, we configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). Since the frontend and backend are running on different ports, we need to explicitly allow the frontend to make requests to the backend. CORS Configuration in Flask: The Flask backend is configured to allow requests from the frontend port (127.0.0.1:4887). This ensures that the browser doesn’t block the API requests due to cross-origin restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2><span style=\"color:#e194ff\"> College Board Requirements Met: </span></h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use of HTTP and RESTful APIs: I created the star API that interacts with the backend using GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE functions (see below). This ties into our national park page through the overall star review section.\n",
    "2. Performance Optimization: I use **caching** by storing the stars in the cache until the \"Submit\" button is selected, as well as indexing the database for previous records, thus meeting Performance Optimization requirements.\n",
    "3. Monitoring and Logging: Logging occurs through the console log, with error statements being printed for debugging\n",
    "4. Security and Authentication: Each action in my API requires the authentication token, which fetches the JWT token from the cache for each browser session"

    "- Scaling the backend horizontally (adding more instances) using Docker or Kubernetes helps handle more users without overloading a single server.\n",
    "- Optimizing database performance with connection pooling and caching makes sure queries run quickly, even with many users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security: Protecting Data and Access\n",
    "\n",
    "- Setting up firewall rules blocks unwanted traffic and restricts access to only necessary services.\n",
    "- Enabling SSL/TLS encryption ensures data sent between users and the server is secure.\n",
    "- Using JWT tokens, API keys, or OAuth controls who can access different parts of the app.\n",

    "\n",
    "As outlined in our diagram above, our project utilizes all four networking layers to offer a cohesive experience to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Application Layer: HTTP/DNS in Action\n",
    "\n",
    "**Frontend (GitHub Pages)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The frontend, built with modern JavaScript, uses the Fetch API to make HTTP(S) requests to the backend. These requests perform key operations like creating and updating reviews or fetching quiz results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A domain name resolves to the backend’s IP address using DNS (frostbyte.stu.nighthawkcodingsociety.com)\n",
    "- The browser sends HTTP requests, specifying methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), headers, and optional JSON payloads for CRUD operations.\n",
    "- For example, if a user submits a review, the frontend sends a POST request to /api/review with the review data in JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Backend (AWS EC2 with Docker)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The backend processes these requests using Flask and interacts with the SQLite database to handle:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create: Adding new records like user reviews or quiz results.\n",
    "- Read: Retrieving stored data, such as user reviews or analytics.\n",
    "- Update: Modifying existing data entries.\n",
    "- Delete: Removing records from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask sends HTTP responses with status codes, headers, and JSON data back to the frontend for display.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security Matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "Certbot manages SSL/TLS certificates, ensuring all communication between the frontend and backend is encrypted via HTTPS.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Transport Layer: TCP/UDP for Reliable Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP(S) requests are transmitted over TCP, ensuring reliable delivery of data. Here's the flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Request: Nginx routes incoming TCP traffic to the correct Docker container based on the URL path. A three-way TCP handshake establishes a secure connection.\n",
    "- Response: The backend sends responses over the same TCP connection, guaranteeing that data arrives intact and in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Network Layer: Routing the Packets\n",
    "\n",
    "At this layer, TCP segments carrying HTTP requests are encapsulated into IP packets. These packets are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sent: Routed across the internet to the AWS EC2 instance.\n",
    "- Received: AWS handles routing and load balancing before the backend processes the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "The backend sends the response back to the client in the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Physical Layer: The Hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "Data ultimately travels through physical infrastructure—cables, routers, and wireless access points—before reaching the client. Whether the user is on Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or mobile data, the process remains seamless.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Our Tools: The Backbone of Development\n",
    "\n",
    "- Docker: Ensures consistent backend deployment across development, testing, and production.\n",
    "- Nginx: Routes incoming traffic and manages connections between the frontend and backend.\n",
    "- Certbot: Secures communication with SSL/TLS certificates.\n",
    "- SQLite: Stores data for CRUD operations, from reviews to analytics.\n",
    "- JavaScript Fetch API: Powers asynchronous HTTP requests from the frontend.\n",
    "- Flask: Provides RESTful APIs for handling requests and interacting with the database."

    "4. To build the docker environment: docker-compose build & docker-compose up -d\n",
    "5. Finally, we will test our server with curl\n",
    "        docker ps # looking for port 8102\n",
    "        curl localhost:8102\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will set up our domain on Route53 (domain will be frostbyte.stu.nighthawkcodingsociety.com) and test DNS through WSL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we have already set up Nginx on our backend; we will work on setting it up on the AWS server to function with our backend database, as well as setting up Certbot for authentication. "
