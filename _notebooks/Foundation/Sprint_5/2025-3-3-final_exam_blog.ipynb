When working in larger groups this trimester, I was exposed to new, innovative methods of completing tasks. These ideas, such as designs for frontend pages, backend organization, and even blog creation and group role dynamics, were different from my own methods; I learned from my team members and was able to improve my own understanding of team projects. Additionally, I learned how to work with different work styles and how to encourage teammates to work towards a common final objective.\n",
