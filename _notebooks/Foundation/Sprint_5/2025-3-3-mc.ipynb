My mistakes ranged over many of the big ideas, proving I am not significantly lacking in any one topic (I instead need to work on improving my overall test-taking strategies such as reading the question and slowing down).\n",

    "<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/images/trimester2final/mc/15.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Selected:** ```Program B displays one more value than program A.```\n",

    "**Correct:** ```Program A and program B display identical values in the same order.```\n",

If this pattern continues, which of the following best approximates the total number of registered users, in millions, in year 12 (two years after the last entry in the table) ?```\n",

    "**Q:** ```A flowchart is a way to visually represent an algorithm. The flowchart below is used by an application to set the Boolean variable available to true under certain conditions. The flowchart uses the Boolean variable weekday and the integer variable miles. Which of the following statements is equivalent to the algorithm in the flowchart?```\n",

    "**Selected:** ```A device compresses the audio file by removing details that are not easily perceived by the human ear. The compressed file is transmitted to a second device, which plays it.```\n",
