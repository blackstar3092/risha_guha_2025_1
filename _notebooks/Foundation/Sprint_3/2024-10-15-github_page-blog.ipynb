    "<h2><span style=\"font-family: Tahoma; color:#e194ff\"> Project Purpose </span></h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the Sprint 3 was to create an interactive social media platform where users can express their preferences for various items in a certain category. The category for our period was Vote for the Goat, where users vote for their favorite item regarding a certain piece of Del Norte culture. For Sprint 3, my group chose to create a voting platform for the Nighthawk Dnero Store. We split our patform into four categories: Food and Drink, Spirit, Limited Edition, and Gift Cards. Users can select their favorite and least favorite items from these categories, contribute comments, and view posts from others in real-time. This project falls under the social media category, as it encourages user interaction through commenting and posting, while also incorporating elements of productivity by facilitating the collection of preferences and opinions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2><span style=\"font-family: Tahoma; color:#e194ff\"> Understanding and Development </span></h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensuring understanding of this task helped us develop it because until we understood the assignment of creating a chatroom, we were unable to accurately create the voting platform, as we were spending too much time on the liking element as opposed to the commenting element. As our project evolved, the necessity for a dynamic post submission form and backend integration became clear. The development process involved ensuring a smooth interaction between the frontend (user interface) and backend (database) to allow users to select items, post their preferences, and view others' posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3><span style=\"font-family: Tahoma; color:#e194ff\"> Inputs </span></h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our inputs in this project were user interactions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Selecting an item as a favorite or least favorite.\n",
    "- Filling out the post submission form with a title and comment.\n",
    "- Choosing a group and channel from dropdown menus for submitting posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "These inputs are captured using HTML form elements and buttons, with JavaScript handling the logic to display forms and capture selection details.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3><span style=\"font-family: Tahoma; color:#e194ff\"> Events </span></h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Events are generated when users interact with the page, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clicking on an item button (to select it as a favorite or least favorite).\n",
    "- Submitting the post form (triggering a post creation event).\n",
    "- Selecting a category, group, or channel, which dynamically updates the form.\n",
    "\n",
    "These events are processed by JavaScript functions that alter the UI (e.g., changing button colors, showing the post form) and communicate with the backend (e.g., sending the post data to the server).\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3><span style=\"font-family: Tahoma; color:#e194ff\"> Outputs </span></h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Outputs include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dynamic display of the items based on user interaction (buttons for selecting items).\n",
    "- The post form that appears when an item is selected.\n",
    "- The categorized posts appearing below each item list once submitted by the users, fetched dynamically from the backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3><span style=\"font-family: Tahoma; color:#e194ff\"> User Interface Design </span></h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "The user interface is designed with clear, interactive elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Category Boxes: Each category has a collapsible section for selecting favorite and least favorite items within a specific subcategory of the Dnero Store.\n",
    "- Post Form: Once an item is selected, the post form is revealed, allowing users to create a post with a title, comment, and associated category.\n",
    "- Post Display: Posts from users are dynamically fetched and displayed under the relevant category at all times, showing users what other people think.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3><span style=\"font-family: Tahoma; color:#e194ff\"> Data Definition </span></h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "The backend manages data such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Posts: Containing fields for title, comment, channel_id, and user information.\n",
    "- Categories: \"Food and Drink\", \"Spirit\", \"Limited Edition\", and \"Gift Cards\" are predefined as channels for posts.\n",
    "- Items: The items users can select (e.g., \"Trail Mix\", \"Pizza\", \"Morning Song\"). The data structure supports dynamic filtering and displaying of posts based on category, using the channel_id to link posts with specific items.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2><span style=\"font-family: Tahoma; color:#e194ff\"> Individual Coding Knowledge: </span></h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "My personal coding contributions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Writing JavaScript Functions: Writing functions like selectItem to manage item selection and toggle the post form, and fetchPosts to load posts dynamically.\n",
    "- Backend Integration: Using the fetch API to send and receive data from the backend (for fetching posts and submitting new ones).\n",
    "- UI/UX Design: Implementing the layout using HTML and CSS, as well as designing colors and buttons to match a cohesive theme.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3><span style=\"font-family: Tahoma; color:#e194ff\"> Frontend Coding </span></h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "The frontend is organized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- HTML: Structure for displaying categories, item lists, and the post form.\n",
    "- CSS: Styling to ensure a consistent and attractive design.\n",
    "- JavaScript: Handles the user interactions (item selection, form display, data fetching). The toggleItems function shows or hides item lists, while selectItem handles the logic for selecting an item, changing button colors, and revealing the post form.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3><span style=\"font-family: Tahoma; color:#e194ff\"> Backend Coding </span></h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "The backend handles the data storage and retrieval:\n",
    "\n",
    "- API: The backend exposes endpoints for fetching posts (/api/posts), filtering them by category, and posting new data (/api/post).\n",
    "- Database: The backend stores user posts, categories, and item selections, which are retrieved by the frontend when users interact with the page. It also ensures that data is properly stored with each post, including the userâ€™s comment and the selected category.\n",
    "\n",
    "This separation allows the frontend to handle user interactions and display logic while the backend focuses on data management and serving the correct information when requested.\n"
