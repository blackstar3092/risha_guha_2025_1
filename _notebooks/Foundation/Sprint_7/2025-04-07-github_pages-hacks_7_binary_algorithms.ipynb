        "In order to effectively implement binary search algorithm, the length of the number list does not necessarily have to be even. If the number list is odd, it will still be split into two slightly uneven halves. Additionally, even if the function has duplicate values, it will not affect the midpoint calculations, thus ensuring that the binary search algorithm still works efficiently. The value of the target is also not factored into the index number, so the value of the target can be equal to -1. \n",

        "This leaves us with the answer of C: the values in numList must be in sorted order. If the values are not in sorted order, the algorithm can not effectively increase or decrease its index number based on the size of the value selected; it will instead be arbitrary causing the algorithm to fail.

Option C is present in both linear and binary search algorithms, which makes it neither an advantage nor a disadvantage, and finally, Option D is incorrect, as binary search will just return the first found value in the set (it does not need all unique values).
