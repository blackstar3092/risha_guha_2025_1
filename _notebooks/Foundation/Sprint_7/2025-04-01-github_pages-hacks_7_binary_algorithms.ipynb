        "In order to effectively implement binary search algorithm, the length of the number list does not necessarily have to be even. If the number list is odd, it will still be split into two slightly uneven halves. Additionally, even if the function has duplicate values, it will not affect the midpoint calculations, thus ensuring that the binary search algorithm still works efficiently. The value of the target is also not factored into the index number, so the value of the target can be equal to -1. \n",

If the values are not in sorted order, the algorithm can not effectively increase or decrease its index number based on the size of the value selected; it will instead be arbitrary causing the algorithm to fail.
