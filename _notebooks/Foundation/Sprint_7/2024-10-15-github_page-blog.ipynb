    "I will be prepared for the College Board exam because I learned about variables, data types, mathematical expressions, strings, loops, and dictionaries. I did not have many of these skills before this class, so learning from my classmates allowed me to effectively prepare for the exam. I also strengthened my own understanding of nested conditionals because by teaching the content and answering questions about it, I deepened my own knowledge.\n",

    "Here is a list of all of the skills I learned in each of the following lessons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 3.1: Variables and Data Types (int, str, bool, float, list, and dictionary)\n",
    "- 3.2: More in-depth explanations of Integers, Floats, Strings, Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets, Booleans, and Null\n",
    "- 3.3: Mathematical Expressions ( Sequencing and various operations)\n",
    "- 3.4: Strings and Functions\n",
    "- 3.5: Booleans\n",
    "- 3.8: Loops (While Loops and For Loops)\n",
    "- 3.10: List, Dictionary, and Array Manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "My group and I taught lessons 3.6 and 3.7: Conditionals and Nested Conditionals. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our lesson (3.6 and 3.7) was memorable because we taught students to use conditional statements in JavaScript and Python to control what happens in their programs based on specific conditions. We discussed if, else, and else if statements to check if certain conditions are true or false and execute different parts of the code accordingly. Our hacks tested students' ability to write simple interactive programs that make decisions based on user input or data. In 3.7, we taught how to use nested conditionals. We demonstrated how to implement nested if, elif, and else statements to create more specific control flows in programs. Through examples and exercises, we ensured that students gained a deeper understanding of how to manage multiple conditions effectively, enhancing the logic of the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Unique Element:** Our team customized our lesson pages to bring engagement to the class, and we played games with the class to check their understanding and motivate them for the homework."

    "Using this format, we graded each of the groups in the class by cross-referencing the published College Board learning standards with what was taught in the lesson. We also reflected on the effectiveness of each homework and popcorn hack, as well as the clarity of their examples and grading plan. Overall, this peer grade taught us what we can do to improve our personal lessons as well as the glows and grows of each of the other groups in our class. \n",
    "\n",
    "One group that was very memorable in our class was group 3.3 and 3.5 because I learned a lot about DeMorgan's law and the truth table, which are skills that I will need to know for the AP Exam. It was memorable because it was organized with enough time for each of the Popcorn and Homework Hacks. Additionally, group 3.1 and 3.4 was memorable because they walked through the console log process, which was very helpful."

    "\n",
    "My personal accomplishment of Sprint 2 was creating an engaging lesson that effectively taught my classmates about nested conditionals. This is beyond perfunctory because it was a live, real-time way to gauge my classmates' level of understanding by the class's overall performance on the Kahoot we created. The average Kahoot score was high, and therefore, my lesson was successful. I also learned many different parts of the Python and Javascript languages and feel much more comfortable with these languages than before because of my classmates' lessons. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, I completed many bonus hacks to challenge myself, especially in 3.2, as I wanted to ensure that my understanding was as deep as it should be for the AP Exam in May. I challenged myself to complete hacks as fast as I could to factor in the time factor of the AP Exam. Overall, Sprint 2 taught me many valuable skills for Python and Javascript coding, and I believe it will make my holistic experience in CSP more enjoyable.  "
