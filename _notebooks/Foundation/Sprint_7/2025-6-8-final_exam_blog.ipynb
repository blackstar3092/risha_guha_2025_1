I served as <strong>Scrum Master</strong>, helping lead the team through Agile sprints, and contributed to <strong>both frontend (JavaScript OOP game logic)</strong> and <strong>backend (Python APIs for scoring and data)</strong>. The game was deployed with <strong>AWS RDS</strong> for scalable user tracking. We presented the game at <strong>Night @ the Museum</strong> and received valuable feedback from over 25 visitors.\n",
