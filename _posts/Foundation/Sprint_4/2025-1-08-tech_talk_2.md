### Import and Setup:
- in "_ _ init _ _", objects and db objects are stored
    - Lines like database, app.config[SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS] and others are found in _ _ init _ _ (imported)
    - Don't need to redefine

### DB Models:
- Class: Basis for OOP coding (encapsulator for code)
    - Way to purify the code and keep it separate from rest of the code
    - Reference code through this class
- db.model: addition of code from different library that creates the SQLite table
    - Pull and push from a table (DB)
    - Data types defined when adding new data to table
- Class is singular, table is plural (example: class User and table Users)
